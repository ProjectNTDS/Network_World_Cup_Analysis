# Project Wikipedia

REMARKS : 
Per hour sampling is too hard (according to TA). Limit to per day (feature verctors with 30 entries for 30 days for each node). 

## TASK 0 : get the data
Use API to get the data (for players):

Also find teams and countries in the World Cup. This is done manually

1) need countries not in the world cup. Sample that shit. Maybe every country that ever played in the world cup? 


## World Cup project

Why: network related with an evident hierarchical strucutre (players, teams, country) in one of the most hyped event in the World. 

### Main questions:
#### 1. Network analysis: 
- Can we, based on properties of the nodes, identify the categories in a network made of countries, national teams and players connected by the hyperlinks? Are leafs players, centre countries, ... ? Show network with actual labels coloured (should be scale-free). The links are based on the hyperlinks scraped. 

#### 2. Where was the world cup? Identify the countries that participate at each level?
- Getting the number of visits on the year (2017-2018 on per month basis) on countries, can we identify a peak in the popularity of the country matching the world cup? We could normalise that value by the average on a non-world year or a non-world cup part of the year and observe if there's a variation noticable. Applying high pass filter, it should be standing out of the common fluctuations.

- Network idea for this: nodes = country. Links based on number (normalised/fitlered signal?) of visit per month and a certain threshold. Idea 1: normalise that signal and display an evovling network (one for each month) with nodes fixed. Given a certain threshold, can we see the countries of the world cup linking each other during the event (show it evolving and at that time display the participating countries with colour and check the links connect them. Rapidly eliminated countries may not be linked => conclude). Maybe apply some filter to remove the low frequencies events of each country signal, then normalise and use this as a signal. 

#### 3. Can we identify the date of the matches?
- Idem for a match on a per day basis centred around the right date. - Look at the evolution of number of views. Is there a peak for certain countries matching the match dates? 

- Building a feature graph (nodes =  players+countries  and links depends on number of visits per day and a certain threshold), can we identify the match? Could we see the graph evolving in a significant manner when linking fixed nodes based on the number of visit (above a certain threshold): do players connect naturally when a match has happened? Do we see matches or teams patterns emerging. 

#### 4. Identify the players in each team?

- Using the network of hyperlinks (each player is connected to the page of the team), can we cluster football players into the teams that played in the world cup? For exemple, putting a delta signal on a country should first transmit the heat to the team it is linked to. 

- Slight twist to the network: compute Pearson correlation score (or any other metric of simularity: experiment men/woman!) between feature vector of each player. High correlation is mostly due to similar behaviour exhibited by the team structure (players of the same team play at the same time and are thus likely to be "wikipedia" on the same time => correlation). Connecting players based on that correlation (threshold), can we, on the resulting network, observe cluster. 

#### 5. Say something about the <b>smoothness</b> of the graph (node = players and links arranged to connect the teams): 
- For a given date and a given team, observe signal on the team (each player). Is it smooth or peaky (some players more search). Does it link to the performance of these players and is there a correlation with the result of the match for that team [smoother= lost, peaky = won (high number of good performances giving a lot of search for the associated players)?]. 

[Same but formulated badly : find date match, observe if there's a peak on the team. Look at the peak on each players. So we limit ourselves to the team, and look at the distribution. Does it link to the team ? Can we spot the players that scored (maybe normalise each player by the average value). Is there a change in smoothness depending on the outcome? (woudln't the less smooth team have more noticeble performances (be them good or bad).]

#### 6. Open Question (could be baaaaaad) : During the match: identify the scoring players and man of the match?
- Take a player and show is signal on the month of the world cup. normalise/filter crap and check if any higher peak can be associated to a goal. Can we give a threshold on that signal to conclude that, yes or no, that player scored

### Extra questions (highly useless)
- which player is better known than his country?
- which players broke into fame following the world cup?

### Use for project:
countries, players, teams 
number of views different timestamps (is an hour reachable?)
world cup schedule for gathering the data
