## World Cup project

### Main questions:
1) Where was the world cup?
> Getting the number of visits on year on specific sport related categories, can we identify a peak matching the world cup? 

2) Can we identify the date/time of the match?
> Idem for a match. 

3) Identify the countries that participate at each level?
> Idem. 

4) Identify the players in each team?
> Using the network (each player is connected to the page of the team), can we cluster football players into the teams that played in the world cup? 

5) During the match: identify the scoring players and man of the match?
> Should be a peak in number of visits for these nodes.

### Extra questions:
which player is better known than his country?
which players broke into fame following the world cup?

### Use for project:
countries, players, teams 
number of views different timestamps (is an hour reachable?)
world cup schedule for gathering the data
