# Project

## World Cup project

### Main questions:
1) Network analysis.: Can we, based on properties of the nodes, identify the categories in a network made of countries, national teams and players?  (should be scale-free)

{
2) Where was the world cup?
> Getting the number of visits on year on specific sport related categories, can we identify a peak matching the world cup? 

3) Can we identify the date/time of the match?
> Idem for a match on a per day basis centred around the right date.  
}

4) Identify the countries that participate at each level?
> Look at the evolution of number of views. Is there a peak for certain countries matching the match dates? 
> Building a feature graph (connecting players+countries depending on number of visits), can we identify the countries? 

5) Identify the players in each team?
> Building a feature graph (connecting players+countries depending on number of visits), can we identify the teams?
> Using the network (each player is connected to the page of the team), can we cluster football players into the teams that played in the world cup? For exemple, putting a peak on a country should first transmit the heat to the team it is linked to. 

6) During the match: identify the scoring players and man of the match?
> Should be a peak in number of visits for these nodes.

### Extra questions:
which player is better known than his country?
which players broke into fame following the world cup?

### Use for project:
countries, players, teams 
number of views different timestamps (is an hour reachable?)
world cup schedule for gathering the data
